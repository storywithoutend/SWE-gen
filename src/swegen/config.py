class PublishConfig:
    """Configuration for publishing generated tasks to a dataset repository.

    When present on a CreateConfig/FarmConfig, every validated task is copied into
    a clone of ``repo``, committed on its own branch cut fresh from ``base_branch``,
    pushed, and opened as a pull request. Farm state is committed to a separate,
    per-source-repo branch so an ephemeral sandbox can resume where it left off.

    Attributes:
        repo: Dataset repository in "owner/repo" format (receives the task PRs)
        token: Token with contents:write + pull_requests:write on ``repo``
        tasks_path: Directory within ``repo`` that tasks are written to
        base_branch: Branch every task branch is cut from, and that PRs target
        branch_prefix: Prefix for per-task branches ("task/" -> "task/<task_id>")
        state_branch_prefix: Prefix for the per-source-repo state branch. Git refs are a
            directory namespace, so a bare "farm-state" branch cannot coexist with
            "farm-state/<slug>" - only the prefixed form is ever created.
        state_path: Directory within the state branch holding state JSON
        clone_dir: Where to clone the dataset repo. Defaults to
            .swegen/publish/<dataset_slug>/<source_slug>, keyed by source repo so two
            farms sharing a host never fight over one working tree.
        dry_run: Perform local clone/branch/commit but skip pushes and PR creation
        cleanup_local: Delete the local task directory once the task is durably published
            (a real PR/branch on the dataset repo). Frees disk on resource-constrained
            sandboxes. Never deletes on dry-run, on publish failure, or when the task was
            not actually published - the dataset repo must hold the only surviving copy.
        author_name: git author/committer name for task and state commits
        author_email: git author/committer email for task and state commits
